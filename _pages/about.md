<span style="font-size:16px; text-align: justify;">Hi, this is Yao, I am a sea-going physical oceanographer and research scientist at School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, <span style="font-weight:bold">Georgia Institute of Technology</span> (<a href="https://eas.gatech.edu//">Geogia Tech</a>). I am also on the way becoming a photographer. On this website, you will find my most recent research and photos I recently shot during weekend trips.</span>

My research
======
<span style="font-size:16px; text-align: justify;">Climate change has become a trending topic and yet the ocean's role in the climate is far from being understood. I love the ocean since childhood, because I always feel the ocean brings me peace. Luckly I followed my interest and I become a physical oceanographer. My research mainly focuses on large-scale circulation in the Atlantic Ocean and its impact on global climate. I am particularly interested in understanding the variability of ocean circulation and how their changes impact regional to global climate system. Here are some of my research topics:</span>
1. Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and water mass (<span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abc7836">AMOC</a></span> <span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/os-14-589-2018">water mass</a></span>) 
2. Subtropic Cell (<span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2021JC018191">STC</a></span>) 
3. Watermass property change (<span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JC014878">AAIW</a></span>) 
4. Wind-driven circulation (<span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/os-13-531-2017">Ekman transport</a></span>)

About me
======
<span style="font-size:16px; text-align: justify;">I am Chinese and have been living abroad for many years. I finished my undergraduate study in a coastal city, Dalian in China. Then I moved to Northern Germany and lived there for about 7 years. I got my master and Ph.D degree in physical oceanography at GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel and enjoyed traveling around Europe very much. Before starting my current position in the US, I also moved back to China and worked there as a scientist for 3 years. Currently, I am exploring work and life in the US and practicing photography.</span>
