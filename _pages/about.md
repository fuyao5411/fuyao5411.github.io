<span style="font-size:16px; text-align: justify;">Hi, this is Yao, I am a sea-going physical oceanographer and research scientist at School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, <span style="font-weight:bold">Georgia Institute of Technology</span> (<a href="https://eas.gatech.edu//">Geogia Tech</a>). I am also on the way becoming a photographer. On this website, you will find my most recent research and photos I recently shot during weekend trips.</span>

My research
======
<span style="font-size:16px; text-align: justify;">Climate change has become a trending topic and yet the ocean's role in the climate is far from being understood. I love the ocean since childhood, because I always feel the ocean brings me peace. Luckly I followed my interest and I become a physical oceanographer. My research mainly focuses on large-scale circulation in the Atlantic Ocean and its impact on global climate. I am particularly interested in understanding the variability of ocean circulation and how their changes impact regional to global climate system. Here are some of my research topics:</span>
1. Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (<span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abc7836">AMOC</a></span>) 
2. Subtropic Cell (STC)
3. Watermass property change
4. Wind-driven circulation

About me
======
<span style="font-size:16px; text-align: justify;">I am a Chinese who lives abroad for many years. I finished my undergraduate study in a coastal city, Dalian in China. Then I moved to Northern Germany and lived there for about 7 years. I got my master and Ph.D degree in physical oceanography there and enjoyed traveling around Europe a lot. Before relocating myself to the US, I also moved back to China and worked there as an scientist for 3 years. Currently, I am exploring work and life in the US and practicing photography.</span>
