<span style="font-size:16px; text-align: justify;">Hi there~, welcome to my website. This is Yao. I am a sea-going physical oceanographer. Currently, I work as a research scientist at School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology ([Georgia Tech](https://eas.gatech.edu//)). I will soon start my new faculty position at College of Marine Science ([CMS](https://www.usf.edu/marine-science/)), <span style="font-weight:bold">University of South Florida </span> (<a href="https://www.usf.edu//">USF</a>) as an assistant professor. I am also on the way becoming a photographer. On this website, you will find my most recent research and some photos I recently shot.</span>

My research
======
<span style="font-size:16px; text-align: justify;"> Climate change has become a central issue in global discussion. Yet the ocean's critical role in regulating our climate is far from being understood. My fascination with the ocean began in childhood, drawn to the peace it brings. This passion led me to pursue a career as a physical oceanographer, where my research centers on large-scale ocean circulation in the Atlantic and its influence on global climate. Below are some of the key topics in my research:</span>
1. Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and water mass (<span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abc7836">AMOC</a></span> <span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-023-00848-9">OSNAP</a></span>) 
2. Subtropic Cell (<span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2021JC018191">STC</a></span>) 
3. Watermass property change (<span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JC014878">AAIW</a></span>) 
4. Wind-driven circulation (<span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/os-13-531-2017">Ekman transport</a></span>)

About me
======
<span style="font-size:16px; text-align: justify;">I am Chinese and have been living abroad for many years. I finished my undergraduate study in a coastal city, Dalian in China. Then I moved to Northern Germany and lived there for about 7 years. I got my master and Ph.D degree in physical oceanography at GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel and enjoyed traveling around Europe very much. Before starting my current position in the US, I also moved back to China and worked there as a scientist for 3 years. Currently, I am exploring work and life in the US and practicing photography.</span>
