excerpt: 'The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is importantfor the global climate due to its role in redistributing heat, freshwater, and dissolved gases over broad spatialscales. Through continuous observations, we now have an 8‐year (2014–2022) time series of volume, heat andfreshwater transports in the subpolar North Atlantic (∼60°N). Using these data, our analysis focuses on characterizing the interannual variability of the AMOC. We first investigated the importance of boundarycurrents and found that any single boundary current can account for up to ∼30% of the total AMOC interannualvariability. Using a number of data sets, we then quantified the relationship between the water mass formationthrough surface cooling and freshening, the storage of water masses in ocean basins, and the AMOC oninterannual timescales. We find an expected relationship in the eastern subpolar basin (between Greenland andthe UK), where formation leads to increased basin storage, which further results in enhanced AMOC.'

Understanding the variability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is essential for better predictions of our changing climate. Here we present an updated time series (August 2014 to June 2020) from the Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP). The 6-year time series allows us to observe the seasonality of the subpolar overturning and meridional heat and freshwater transports. The overturning peaks in late spring and reaches a minimum in early winter, with a peak-to-trough range of 9.0 Sv. The overturning seasonal timing can be explained by winter transformation and the export of dense water, modulated by a seasonally varying Ekman transport.
