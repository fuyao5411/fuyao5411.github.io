<span style="font-size:16px; text-align: justify;">Hi there~, welcome to my website. I am an assistant professor of physical oceanography at the College of Marine Science ([CMS](https://www.usf.edu/marine-science/)), <span style="font-weight:bold">University of South Florida </span> (<a href="https://www.usf.edu//">USF</a>). I study large-scale ocean circulation using a combination of observational and modeling data. I am interested in understanding the dynamics of ocean circulation and its role in earth's climate and marine biogeochemical cycle. Here you will find some of my recent studies on the AMOC and I am recruiting <span style="font-weight:bold">graduate students</span> to start in fall 2026. Please see [Prospective student webpage](https://www.usf.edu/marine-science/education/prospective-students/index.aspx//) for information about the application process. Alongside my scientific work, I’m also exploring my passion for photography. Here, you’ll find updates on my latest research and some of my recent photography work.</span>

My research
======
<span style="font-size:16px; text-align: justify;"> Climate change has become a central issue in global discussion. Yet the ocean's critical role in regulating our climate is far from being understood. My fascination with the ocean began in childhood, drawn to the peace it brings. This passion led me to pursue a career as a physical oceanographer, where my research centers on large-scale ocean circulation in the Atlantic and its influence on global climate. Below are some of the key topics in my research:</span>
1. Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and water mass (<span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abc7836">AMOC</a></span> <span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-023-00848-9">OSNAP</a></span>) 
2. Subtropic Cell (<span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2021JC018191">STC</a></span>) 
3. Watermass property change (<span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JC014878">AAIW</a></span>) 
4. Wind-driven circulation (<span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/os-13-531-2017">Ekman transport</a></span>)

About me
======
<span style="font-size:16px; text-align: justify;">I grew up in a small city in the Northeastern part of China, where it is very cold in winter and snows a lot, but can be very comfortable in summer as well. I completed my undergraduate studies in the coastal city of Dalian, China. I then moved to Northern Germany, where I earned my master and Ph.D. degrees in physical oceanography at GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel and Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel.  During that time, I enjoyed traveling throughout Europe. Before moving to the U.S., I also had three years working experience in Guangzhou, China. Now, I am exploring both work and life in Florida, while I am also practicing photography.</span>
