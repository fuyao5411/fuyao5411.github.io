excerpt: 'his work examine the meridional Ekman volume, heat and salt transport in the tropical Atlantic using ship-board and satellite observations, e.g., CTD, underway-CTD, ADCP, and wind data. We find that the top of the pycnocline is the best representation fo the penetration depth of the Ekman flow in the tropical Atlantic.'

This work examine the meridional Ekman volume, heat and salt transport in the tropical Atlantic using ship-board and satellite observations, e.g., CTD, underway-CTD, ADCP, and wind data. We find that the top of the pycnocline, defined as the the shallowest depth at which the density gradient is larger than 0.01 kg m^{-4}, is the best representation fo the penetration depth of the Ekman flow in the tropical Atlantic.
