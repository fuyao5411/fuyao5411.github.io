excerpt: 'The AMOC is important for the global climate due to its role in redistributing heat, freshwater, and dissolved gases over broad spatial scales. Through continuous observations, we now have  8‐year (2014–2022) time series of volume, heat and freshwater transports in the subpolar North Atlantic (∼60°N). Using these data, our analysis focuses on characterizing the interannual variability of the AMOC. We first investigated the importance of boundary currents and found that any single boundary current can account for up to ∼30% of the total AMOC interannualvariability. We then quantified the relationship between the water mass formation through surface cooling and freshening, the storage of water masses in ocean basins, and the AMOC on interannual timescales. We find an expected relationship in the eastern subpolar basin (between Greenland andthe UK), where formation leads to increased basin storage, and further results in enhanced AMOC.'

Variability of the AMOC has drawn extensive attention due to its impact on the global redistribution of heat and freshwater. Here we present the latest timeseries (2014–2022) of the Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP) and characterize MOC interannual variability. We find that any single boundary current captures ∼30% of subpolar MOC interannual variability. However, to fully resolve AMOC variability, a wide swath across the eastern subpolar basin is needed; in the Labrador Sea both boundaries are needed. Through a volume budget analysis for the subpolar basins'lower limbs, we estimate the magnitude of unresolved processes (e.g., diapycnal mixing) required to close the mean budget (∼2 Sv). We find that in the eastern subpolar basin surface‐forced transformation variability is linked to lower limb volume variability, which translates to MOC changes within the same year. In contrast, this linkage is weak in the Labrador Sea
