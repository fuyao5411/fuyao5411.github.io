By combining hydrographic section data with a box inverse model, we studied the AMOC and associated heat and freshwater trasport in the tropical-subtropical North Atlantic. We identified water mass property changes over the studied area. By comparing the inverse model solution with observations, e.g.,RAPID and assimilation product, e.g., GECCO2, we conclude that the AMOC strength has not significantly decreased over the studies period (between 1989 and 2015) in the tropical-subtropical North Atlantic. This work's finding leads to the study on the [subpolar overturning](/publication/2020-paper-Fuetal2020).
