By using Argo and GECCO2 assimilation data, we investigated the interannual variability of Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) in the tropical North Atlantic. The results highlight the role of western boundary current system in driving the interannual variability of AAIW in the tropical Northwestern Atlantic.
