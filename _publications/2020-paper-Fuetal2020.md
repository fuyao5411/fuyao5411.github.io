excerpt: 'The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and water mass property changes in the north Atlantic are jointly studied using a compilation of hydrographic section data, array observation, satellite altimetry, and ocean syntheses pruduct. The results indicate that water mass property and overturning circulation do not vary at the same pace, suggesting a higher degree of decoupling between the two processes than we previously expect.'

The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and water mass property changes in the north Atlantic are jointly studied using a compilation of hydrographic section data, array observation, satellite altimetry, and ocean syntheses pruduct. The results show that despite substantial changes occured in the water mass properties and dissolved oxygen in the Subpolar North Atlantic, the AMOC remain stable over the past 3 decades. This indicates that water mass property and overturning circulation do not vary at the same pace, suggesting a higher degree of decoupling between the two processes than we previously expect.
