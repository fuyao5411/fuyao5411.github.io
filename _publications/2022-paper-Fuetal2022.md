excerpt: 'his work examine the meridional Ekman volume, heat and salt transport in the tropical Atlantic using ship-board and satellite observations, e.g., CTD, underway-CTD, ADCP, and wind data. We find that the top of the pycnocline is the best representation fo the penetration depth of the Ekman flow in the tropical Atlantic.'

#This work examine the meridional Ekman volume, heat and salt transport in the tropical Atlantic using ship-board and satellite observations, e.g., CTD, underway-CTD, ADCP, and wind data. We find that the top of the pycnocline, defined as the the shallowest depth at which the density gradient is larger than 0.01 kg m^{-4}, is the best representation fo the penetration depth of the Ekman flow in the tropical Atlantic.
